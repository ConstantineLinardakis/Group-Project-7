### Year 2 Concepts
* GUI Controls
  * JButtons
  * JLabels
  * JFrame
* Inheritance
  * I inherit JButton for loop and stop classes
  * I also inherit thread in the launchpad class  
* Interfaces 
  * ActionListener
    * Button Class
    * Loop Button Class
    * Stop Button Class
    * Color Change Button Class
* Enhanced For Loop
  * Used in Launchpad class to loop through clips in linked list
* Override
  * All ActionListener methods
  * public void run in launchpad
* Multidimensional Array is used for sound buttons on screen
* Exception handling and I/O is used to read sound files and play all clips
* We use a linked list as a way to store all looping sounds
